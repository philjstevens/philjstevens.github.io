      <description>I spent most of last week in a classroom in Inverness, learning lots but gettig distracted by photos of great early season conditions in the Northern Corries. Fortunately Malcolm &amp;ldquo;Malcy&amp;rdquo; Airey and I both had a day free on Friday, and the weather looked like it would stay cold enough for long enough. Just.
Malcy is usually pretty keen to talk his own ability down, but many of us know he&amp;rsquo;s handier than he believes.</description>
