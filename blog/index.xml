      <description>I spent most of last week in a classroom in Inverness, learning lots but gettig distracted by photos of great early season conditions in the Northern Corries. Fortunately Malcolm &amp;ldquo;Malcy&amp;rdquo; Airey and I both had a day free on Friday, and the weather looked like it would stay cold enough for long enough. Just.
Malcy is usually pretty keen to talk his own ability down, but many of us know he&amp;rsquo;s handier than he believes.</description>

      <description>Snow is in the forecast, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely time to fish the winter gear out of the loft if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already!
Thanks to the dry tooling comp a couple of weekends ago at the Ice Factor, my axes and crampons have already been in use. Just as well, because I noticed a couple of things: 1) My picks have been filed so much they&amp;rsquo;re now an inch shorter than they should be, and 2) because the Petzl mini hammer is so small (apparently the new version is bigger), my tools are getting damaged when I hammer pegs, crud hooks etc.</description>
